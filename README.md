# PhD Dissertation

Welcome to the repository for my Ph.D. dissertation. This repository contains the code for the two chapters, a general equilibrium model and a game theory model. The first chapter employs an exact hat algebra model, following Caliendo and Parro (2017) and Maggi (2017). However, instead of assuming labor mobility across Brazilian states, we allow for intrastate land use changes. For instance, we find that a stricter trade agreement on primary factors by the EU—within the context of the EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement (EMTA)—does not necessarily lead to reduced land use. The second chapter tests numerically the predictions of our modeling. 

The PhD dissertation is composed of two chapters: this general equilibrium model and a game theory model. Working papers for both chapters can be found on my website: [https://alanleal-econ.com/index.php/research/](https://alanleal-econ.com/index.php/research/).  
Questions regarding the dissertation or the code can be directed to: **prof@alanleal-econ.com**.

Due to GitHub’s file size limitations, the dataset for this chapter is hosted in the following folder:  
[Alan Leal-Econ Sharepoint](https://alanlealecon.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/AlanLeal/IgCBrhKEQlOgQJlb7p_Em_l9AfsJ4oU-tatXPD3LEtkdPv4?e=00ssJd)  
The code is also available in this folder and is kept updated alongside this repository.

Julia and MATLAB code implements the general equilibrium model, while R code implements the game theory model.
